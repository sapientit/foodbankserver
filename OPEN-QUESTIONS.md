# Open questions

Things the build had to decide that `INITIAL_SPEC1.txt` does not answer. Each one is a place where
the code is running on a guess — a reasonable guess, but a guess, and the frontend has been built
against it.

**Only Pete answers these.** Neither the server assistant nor the client assistant may close an
entry, including one it raised itself. Two assistants agreeing about what a food bank wants is not
evidence; it is the same guess written down twice. That is exactly how Q0 happened.

## How to use it

**This file holds open questions only.** It is a queue, not an archive. Its length is meant to be
the size of the backlog, so that "how much is still resting on a guess?" is answerable at a glance —
and so that reading the whole thing stays cheap for however many sessions it takes to empty it.

- **Raising one.** Append an entry with the next number. Never renumber, and never reuse a number.
- **Answering one.** Pete writes the answer under **A:**. Only Pete.
- **Closing one.** The assistant that owns the affected repo writes the decision into
  `INITIAL_SPEC1.txt` (see the standing instruction in `CLAUDE.md`), changes the code and the
  contract, removes the matching `x-assumed` from `openapi.yaml`, and then **deletes the entry from
  this file** in the same change.

Deleting is deliberate. Once the answer is in the spec, a copy here is a second place the same
requirement lives, and two homes for one requirement is what this file exists to prevent. Git has
the wording if anyone needs it; the reasoning, if it is worth keeping, belongs in the spec statement
where a reader would look for it anyway.

Q0 stays as the permanent worked example. Everything else leaves when it closes.

`x-assumed` in `openapi.yaml` marks the operations and fields resting on an open entry:

```
grep -n -A3 'x-assumed' openapi.yaml
```

## Q0 — Are stocktaking and shopping admin or team leader jobs? — CLOSED

`Status: closed (2026-07-30)`
`Raised by: Pete`

**A:** Team leader. Both are warehouse jobs. Only the stock _item list_ is admin.

Kept as the worked example. Nobody ever decided stock was admin-only — it was inferred while slice 5
was built, written into `openapi.yaml` as flatly as any real requirement, and the frontend generated
its types from it. Five slices later it was still wrong. The cost of the guess was not making it; it
was making it invisibly.
